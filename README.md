# StrapiSharp

This project builds a binding around the Strapi API to ease the communication between a .NET project and a Strapi backend; attempting to eliminate the need to write any `HttpClient` code yourself.


## Tech Stack

C# 7.0, NUnit, Fluent Assertions


## Documentation

At this time there is no formal documentation. I have tried to provide fairly detailed documentation comments throughout, but have not generated anything further at this point.


## Usage/Examples

Much like the documentation, I do not have anything here ___YET___ as the library is not in a usable state. As StrapiSharp reaches core functionality I will make sure to update this section. 

No Nuget package has been build or published, so you will need to build yourself and reference the library within your own project.


## Running Tests

To run the test suite, run the following command

```bash
  dotnet test
```
